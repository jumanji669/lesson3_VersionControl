            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a system that keeps tracks of any changes that are made to a file or set of files. It basically allows you to look back at different versions of the same file. Version control is very helpful to web designers since you want to keep every version of your webpage on file. Version control basically allows programmers to change files back to what they once were and compare changes over time. This means that group projects, which most programmers have to deal with, are a breeze with version control. Most importantly if a programmer screws up by losing all their files locally Version Control makes it very easy to recover these lost files.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are three types of version control systems: local version control systems, centralized version control systems, and distributed version control systems. A local VCS is unique in the fact that it chooses to copy files into another directory. Although the approach is simple it is also error prone. One can forget what directory they are in and put the wrong files in the wrong place. A centralized VCS is the answer to the issue: collaborating with other developers on other systems. This was the standard for version control for many years. This type of VCS lets everyone know what everyone else is doing. Lastly, a distributed VCS takes snapshots of the latest files, which basically means it mirrors the repository.

            <p class="lead">Git was created in 2005 after the Linux kernel project began using a proprietary DVCS called BitKeeper. Something to keep a note of, during the lifetime of Linux kernel its maintenance changes to the software was done in patches and archived file. In 2005, BitKeeper and the Linux kernel community broke down and because of that it lost its free-to-use status. This was the catalyst needed for Git to be created. Git was designed to be faster, simpler, stronger, and open to everyone. It is also able to handle bigger project, which today is a necessity. Since 2005 Git has become the most popular version control system.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is one of the more popular version control system that was developed in 2005. What makes Git so unique is how Git handles its data. Most version control systems store their data as a list of file-based changes. Basically, they handle information as a set of files and then the changes made to each file are also stored. What Git does differently is that it stores its data in sets of snapshots of what the file looks like. So any time a change is made, Git will take a “picture” of what the files look like. Git treats its data more like a stream of snapshots rather than saving everything like other version control system.

            <p class="lead">For this assignment I had to set up my own Git Repository. First, I had to link my Cloud9 to my Git so I could push my files from Cloud9 to Git. I had to use SSH keys to link the two different websites to each other. I then had to use a couple of Git commands to push my files from Cloud9 to my Git repository. I first used “git init” to create a local repository, then I added files to the repository used “git add .”, and lastly I used “git commit –m” to commit changes to the files in the local repository.
